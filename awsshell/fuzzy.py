"""Fuzzy finder for AWS Shell.

This is a fuzzy finder used for the autocompleter
that I've tried to optimize for the AWS CLI set
of commands.

There doesn't seem to be a generic algorithm that
does exactly what I want.  Changing any of these
heuristics so far means that you have to give up
some other component of the idealized matching.

The main things I care about:

* Special weight is given to subsequences on a
  word boundary.  So "drio" scores higher for
  "describe-reserved-instances_offering" than
  "create-spot-datafeed-subscription".
* The more of the word you complete, the higher
  score it has, so given "describe-instance", then
  "describe-instances" should match higher than
  "describe-instance-attribute" because the former
  matches every single character except for one.
* Similar to one, "rinstance" should rank
  "run-instances" higher than "describe-instances"
  because the "r" falls on a word boundary.

High Level Idea
===============

The basic idea is to try to calculate a numeric
score between 0 and 1 given the users's search
string and a possible word in the corpus of words.

You calculate the score for each word and then sort
them appropriately and return the results in order
back to the user.  A score of 1 is the highest
possible score, it would represent an exact match,
and 0 is the lowest meaning these is no possible chance
for the word to be a match.
